How to get Costumes? there are two or more ways to get costumes as for example, Thru Hourly Points or by Donating Real Money
you can stay ingame and earn hourly points used to buy Costumes from Hourly NPC Shop
however for some lazy and busy players or can afford things with real money(NOTE: we don't recommend this for all players and we don't required you to do this.)
you can also get Costumes from the Donation Shop see more info about the price in our Custom Warper and select the Quest/Room Warp.
